# Cloud & Technical Architecture — GRC Framework

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **practical GRC approach** to documenting and governing cloud and technical architecture for small to mid-sized organizations.

The focus is on:

- Accuracy over perfection
- Current vs planned state clarity
- Audit-ready documentation
- Repeatable delivery for client environments

> This repository contains **no sensitive data** and does not represent any live production environment.

---

## Objectives

- Establish a clear, documented security architecture baseline
- Align technical controls with governance and risk management
- Provide a reusable framework for:
    - Security assessments
    - Architecture design
    - Audit readiness
    - Client delivery

---

## Architecture Domains Covered

### 1. Cloud Account & IAM Foundations

- Account / subscription hierarchy
- Administrative role separation
- Group-based access model
- MFA enforcement
- Break-glass access design

### 2. Network & Access

- SaaS-first access model
- Identity-driven access (SSO + MFA)
- Logical access flow diagrams
- Trust boundaries and assumptions

### 3. Logging & Monitoring

- Definition of core systems
- Minimum security events
- Centralized logging strategy (planned vs implemented)
- Alerting considerations

### 4. Backup & Recovery

- Identification of business-critical data
- SaaS and cloud backup planning
- Offsite encrypted export strategy
- Restore testing expectations

### 5. Device Management

- Endpoint baseline controls
- Full-disk encryption planning
- MDM strategy and enforcement triggers
- Scalability considerations

## GRC Methodology Used

This framework follows a **tiered GRC delivery model**:

- **Tier 1:** Current State Assessment
- **Tier 2:** Architecture Design & Roadmap
- **Tier 3:** Implementation Support & Evidence Readiness

Each tier builds on the same structure to prevent rework and reduce audit risk.

## 📋 Control Alignment

This framework can be aligned to industry standards such as:

- NIST CSF
- ISO 27001
- CIS Controls
- SOC 2

Control mapping documentation can be added as a separate appendix or control-mapping file depending on business or client requirements.
